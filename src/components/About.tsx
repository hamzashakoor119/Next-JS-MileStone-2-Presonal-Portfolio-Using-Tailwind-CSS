        Hi, I'm Hamza Shakoor!
        I am currently a student at SMIT and GIAIC, 
        where Iâ€™m expanding my skills in two key areas.
        At SMIT, I am learning Data Analysis, gaining insights inton data-driven decision-making.
        Simultaneously, I am pursuing a Certified Cloud Applied Generative AI course at GIAIC,
        exploring the cutting-edge field of AI.
